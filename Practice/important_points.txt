a:hover => pseudo class; hover is a state for a tag. 

units in css :
1. Absolute lengths : pixels(px), inches(in), Points(pt)
2. Relative lengths : em, Root em(rem), Percentage(%)

Important points about units : 

    relative units are based on the parents element's size.
    but rem is based on the font size of the root (html) element.

    example :when parent's size is 16px then,
            => 100% = 16px. or 1px = 6.25%
            => 1em = 16px

Importance of rem : responsive banane me kaam aata hai... root(html) ka px size adjust kr baki sare child ka size accordingly apne aap adjust ho jayega ; no need to do it manually.
